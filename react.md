# React

React is a JavaScript Library created by Facebook for creating dynamic and interactive applications and building better UI/UX design for web and mobile applications.

Features of React:

* **JSX** (JavaScript XML) - XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement()` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

* **Virtual DOM** - an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation.

* **Unidirectional data flow/data binding** - data in React flows only in one direction i.e. the data is transferred from top to bottom i.e. from parent components to child components.

* **Reusable/Composable UI Components** - each component is a part of the UI design which has its own logic and design

* **Extension** - React has many extensions that we can use to create full-fledged UI applications (Redux, React Native etc.).

* **Supports server-side rendering**
